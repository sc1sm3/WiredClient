# Wired Frameworks

WiredFrameworks is an Xcode project that regroups library and framework targets involved in the Wired 2.0 implementation on Apple platforms (OSX and iOS).

See this [page](http://www.read-write.fr/wired/wiki) to find more documentation about Wired

## Details

The Xcode project is composed of the following main targets:

- libwired (osx, ios) -> https://github.com/nark/libwired
- WiredFoundation (osx, ios)
- WiredNetworking (osx, ios)
- WiredAppKit (osx)
- WiredUIKit (ios)

## How to use it

For every platforms:
* Init required submodules (libwired and openssl):

		cd WiredFrameworks/
		git submodule update --init --recursive
				
* Add `WiredFrameworks.xcodeproj` as a subproject to your Xcode project.

#### For OSX:

1. In your project's Build Phases, Add libwired-osx, WiredFoundation, WiredNetworking and WiredNetworking **targets as dependencies** of your project.

2. **Link your binary** with WiredFoundation, WiredNetworking and WiredNetworking frameworks.

3. Add a **Copy Files Phase** with its **destination** pointing to "Frameworks" directory, then add WiredFoundation, WiredNetworking and WiredNetworking products to it.

4. In your project's Build Settings, add `@loader_path/../Frameworks` **Runpath Search Paths**.

5. And add `"$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)"` to **Header Search Paths**.

#### For iOS:
